# Segmentation of Pathological Images using QuPath via Fiji Pipeline

## Overview

This repository provides a workflow and resources for segmenting pathological images using a combination of Fiji and QuPath. Fiji is used for pre-processing steps, and QuPath is used for advanced segmentation and analysis.

## Pipeline Description

The typical pipeline involves the following steps:

1.  **Image Acquisition:** Obtain whole slide images (WSIs) from a digital pathology scanner.
2.  **Fiji Pre-processing:**
    * Open the WSI in Fiji.
    * Perform any necessary pre-processing steps, such as:
        * Image normalization
        * Stain separation (e.g., hematoxylin and eosin)
        * Tiling of large images
3.  **QuPath Segmentation:**
    * Import the pre-processed images from Fiji into QuPath.
    * Perform segmentation using QuPath's tools, such as:
        * Cell detection
        * Tissue classification
        * Deep learning-based segmentation
4.  **Analysis and Quantification:**
    * Use QuPath to extract quantitative data from the segmented regions, such as:
        * Cell counts
        * Area measurements
        * Intensity measurements
5.  **Data Export:** Export the processed data for further analysis or visualization.

## Software Requirements

* **Fiji:** A distribution of ImageJ for scientific image analysis. Download from [https://fiji.sc/](https://fiji.sc/)
* **QuPath:** Open-source software for digital pathology image analysis. Download from [https://qupath.github.io/](https://qupath.github.io/)

## Installation

1.  **Install Fiji:** Download and install Fiji following the instructions on the official website.
2.  **Install QuPath:** Download and install QuPath following the instructions on the official website.

## Usage

1.  **Pre-processing in Fiji:**
    * Open your WSI in Fiji.
    * Use Fiji's tools and plugins to perform necessary pre-processing.  For example, you might use the "Colour Deconvolution" plugin to separate hematoxylin and eosin stains.
    * Save the pre-processed image(s).  Consider saving as TIFF files for compatibility.

2.  **Segmentation in QuPath:**
    * Open QuPath.
    * Create a new project.
    * Import the pre-processed images from Fiji.
    * Use QuPath's tools to define your segmentation parameters. This might involve:
        * Using the cell detection tools to identify individual cells.
        * Training a classifier to identify different tissue types.
        * Applying a pre-trained deep learning model (if applicable).
    * Run the segmentation process.
    * Review and refine the segmentation results as needed.  QuPath allows for manual corrections and adjustments.

3.  **Analysis and Quantification in QuPath:**
    * Use QuPath's measurement tools to extract data from the segmented regions.
    * Create annotations to define regions of interest.
    * Export the data to a format suitable for further analysis (e.g., CSV, JSON).

## Example Workflow

Here's a more detailed example workflow:

1.  **Open WSI in Fiji:** Open your WSI (e.g., a .svs file) in Fiji using Bio-Formats.
2.  **Stain Separation in Fiji:** Use the "Colour Deconvolution" plugin in Fiji to separate the hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stains.  This can help improve segmentation accuracy.
3.  **Save TIFF from Fiji:** Save the separated stain images (hematoxylin and eosin channels) as TIFF files.
4.  **Create QuPath Project:** Create a new QuPath project and import the TIFF images.
5.  **Cell Detection in QuPath:** Use QuPath's cell detection tools (e.g., "Cell detection" or StarDist) to identify nuclei. Adjust the parameters as needed for your image.
6.  **Tissue Annotation in QuPath:** Manually annotate different tissue regions (e.g., tumor, stroma) using QuPath's annotation tools.
7.  **Classifier Training (Optional) in QuPath:** If needed, train a classifier in QuPath to automatically identify tissue types based on your annotations.
8.  **Run Segmentation in QuPath:** Run the segmentation process to detect and classify objects in your images.
9.  **Quantification in QuPath:** Use QuPath's measurement tools to quantify features of the segmented objects, such as cell size, intensity, and location.
10. **Export Data from QuPath:** Export the quantification data as a CSV file for further analysis in other software (e.g., R, Python).
